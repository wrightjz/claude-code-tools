description: >
  Designs and scaffolds a self-running, self-verifying agent loop from a
  7-question blueprint. Trigger on: automate a recurring task, schedule an
  agent, run unattended, monitor a condition, triage a queue, poll on a
  cadence, or turn any manual workflow self-running — even if you never
  say the word "loop". Walks through elicit → survey → select → scaffold,
  producing the building blocks with a negotiated contract, a human-gate list,
  and a budget/stop rule. For code loops, defaults to a two-tier check
  (deterministic gate + rubric-scored adversarial review).

# loop-maker

A 4-phase wizard that turns any "I want this to run by itself" intent into a
deployable, auditable agent loop. The output is concrete: a skill folder, a
separate verifier program, a state file, a graded contract, human gates, a
trigger definition, and a budget. When the loop writes code and "done" includes
quality, it also emits a second verification tier — a rubric-scored adversarial
review. Nothing runs until you approve the blueprint and the contract.

---

## The one rule

> **Durable knowledge → a skill (read-only each run).
> Changing state → an external state file (read+written each run).**

A skill is loaded fresh each time the loop fires. It must never accumulate
knowledge between runs — it only carries the logic. Everything that evolves
(progress counters, last-seen timestamps, iteration results, queue position)
lives in a file the loop reads and writes. Mutable state in a `SKILL.md` is
the anti-pattern: it silently disappears the moment the next run loads the
skill from disk.

---

## Why loops need this

An agent cold-starts every run. It has no memory of the previous execution
unless something on disk told it what happened. Without conventions, each run
starts from scratch, rediscovers context, and has no way to know when it is
done. The wizard enforces two things: a checkable exit predicate (so the loop
knows when to stop) and an external state file (so it knows where it left off).
Together they give the loop a consistent world-view across cold starts.

---

## Process: 4 phases

```
elicit  →  survey  →  select  →  scaffold
```

Work through these phases in order. At the start of each phase, print the
breadcrumb:

```
python scripts/loop_progress.py breadcrumb <phase>
```

Create one todo item per phase and check it off before moving to the next.
Do not scaffold until the blueprint is approved.

---

## Phase 1 — Elicit (7 questions, one at a time)

### Detect-first rule

Before asking anything, silently probe the environment:

- Is the working directory a git repo? Is there a remote? (`git remote -v`)
- Is `gh` installed and authenticated? (`gh auth status`)
- Are there existing skills in the host's skill directory that match the goal?
- Is there an active `loops/` folder with a matching name?
- Is there a cron entry, scheduler config, or trigger file already in place?

For any question whose answer the environment reveals, print
`(detected: <value>)` and skip asking the user — this lowers `<total>` in the
progress bar. Show the user what was detected so they can correct it if wrong.

### Asking the questions

Print a progress bar before each question you actually ask:

```
python scripts/loop_progress.py bar <n> <total>
```

`<n>` is the question number (counting only un-detected ones), `<total>` is
how many remain un-detected at elicit start. Ask one question, wait for the
answer, then move to the next.

### The 7 questions

**Q1 — Goal** (maps to the exit predicate *and* the graded contract)
> What condition means the loop is done? State it as something you could
> check with a program — a file exists, an HTTP endpoint returns 200, a count
> reaches a target, a queue is empty. A vibe ("it looks good") won't work;
> a checkable predicate will.
>
> The predicate is the *boundary*. What actually gets graded each iteration is
> a **contract**: a checklist of testable assertions describing "done". Capture
> as many as it takes to make "done" unambiguous — a handful gets
> rubber-stamped. The scaffold seeds `CONTRACT.md` from this and it is approved
> at gate G0 before the first live run. If the goal includes code *quality*
> ("clean", "readable", "would pass a senior/principal review"), say so now — it
> selects the two-tier pattern in Phase 3 and adds review-rubric assertions.

**Q2 — Trigger** (maps to TRIGGER.md)
> How does the loop start each run? Options: a cron schedule, a filesystem
> event, an inbound webhook, an API poll, a manual `gh workflow dispatch`, or
> "run until the goal predicate holds, then stop". Pin down the schedule or
> event precisely — a vague "every day" becomes "0 9 * * 1-5" or similar.
> Flag: verify the exact trigger syntax against current host docs.

**Q3 — Discovery**
> What does the loop look at each run to decide what to do? Examples: a
> directory listing, a GitHub issue list, an RSS feed, a database query, an
> API response. This determines the read connector.

**Q4 — Action** (maps to the loop's core skill step)
> What does the loop actually do each iteration — to what target, using which
> connector? Note: if the action creates or modifies files, consider running
> it in a worktree or scratch directory so each iteration is isolated and the
> main branch is only updated after verification passes.

**Q5 — Verification** (maps to the verifier — a SEPARATE checker)
> How does the loop prove each iteration succeeded before moving on? This must
> be a program with a binary verdict, not a model's opinion. The verifier runs
> after every action and gates the next iteration. It is a separate file from
> the loop skill — template at `scripts/verifier_template.sh`.
>
> If part of "done" is subjective — clean, readable, maintainable, review-worthy
> code — one deterministic script cannot express it. Use the **two-tier** check:
> tier 1 is the deterministic gate (tests/typecheck/lint/build → exit code);
> tier 2 is a rubric-scored *adversarial reviewer* (a separate agent that scores
> the diff against `review-rubric.md`, then `scripts/review_gate.py` turns the
> score into a binary exit code). Tier 2 runs only if tier 1 passes. See
> `references/pattern-two-tier-coding-review.md`.

**Q6 — State**
> What does the loop need to remember between runs? Examples: which items have
> been processed, the last cursor or timestamp, the current iteration count,
> accumulated results. This goes in the state file — see the state backend
> rule below.

**Q7 — Human gates**
> At which points must a human approve before the loop continues? At minimum:
> before the first real run, and when the verifier signals an anomaly. Add
> any domain-specific gates (e.g., before touching production data, before
> sending external messages, when cost exceeds a threshold).

### Two additional captures

**Durable knowledge:** Is there anything the loop needs to know that does not
change between runs — a style guide, a rubric, a list of known-good examples,
a schema? This becomes the loop's own skill, installed alongside the main
skill and loaded read-only each run. For a two-tier coding loop, the review
rubric (`review-rubric.md`) is durable knowledge — capture the axes, weights,
pass threshold, and the calibration examples (2–3 "good", 2–3 "slop") here.

**Budget / stop rule:** What is the maximum cost, iteration count, or elapsed
time before the loop must halt even if the goal predicate has not been met?
This is non-negotiable. A loop without a budget can run forever. Record it as
a hard stop, not a soft suggestion.

---

## Phase 2 — Survey reuse (two passes)

### Pass 2a — Installed capabilities

Check which connectors, skills, and tools are already available in the host
environment. For each one relevant to the loop's action or discovery step,
record a named fallback. Example: if `gh` is present, the GitHub connector is
wired; if a Slack MCP server is loaded, the Slack connector is wired. List
what is available so the scaffold can wire them in rather than stub them.

### Pass 2b — Skill bank search

Dispatch a search sub-agent over `references/skill-bank/`. The sub-agent reads
each entry and returns any skill that overlaps with the loop's goal, trigger, or
action. Anything found gets noted as a reuse candidate — the scaffold will
import or extend it rather than duplicate it.

---

## Phase 3 — Select the simplest pattern

Choose the loop pattern from the table below. Default depends on the goal: if
the loop **writes or modifies code and "done" includes quality**, default to
**two-tier coding review**; otherwise default to **ReAct + deterministic
verifier**. Load only the reference file for the chosen pattern — don't read
the others.

| Pattern | When to use | Reference file |
|---|---|---|
| **Two-tier coding review** (DEFAULT for code + quality) | Loop generates/edits code and "done" is partly subjective — clean, readable, passes a senior/principal review | `references/pattern-two-tier-coding-review.md` |
| **ReAct + deterministic verifier** (DEFAULT otherwise) | One workstream, "done" is a fully program-checkable predicate | `references/pattern-react-deterministic-verifier.md` |
| Evaluator–optimizer | Criteria need judgement and *none* of it is program-checkable | `references/pattern-evaluator-optimizer.md` |
| Orchestrator–workers | Work genuinely parallelizes into independent subtasks | `references/pattern-orchestrator-workers.md` |
| Ralph | Want a crude baseline / teaching loop | `references/pattern-ralph.md` |

State the chosen pattern and one-line rationale before moving to Phase 4.
Flag: check `references/host-adapters.md` for the current Claude Code
scheduler and dispatch mechanics; for non-Claude hosts, verify against that
host's current docs before scaffolding.

---

## Phase 4 — Emit blueprint, then scaffold

### Step 4a — Blueprint approval contract

Before writing any files, render the filled blueprint:

```
python scripts/loop_progress.py blueprint \
  GOAL     "<the checkable predicate from Q1>" \
  CONTRACT "<count of testable assertions · gated at G0>" \
  TRIGGER  "<schedule or event from Q2>" \
  VERIFY   "<tier-1 command · +tier-2 rubric if code>" \
  STATE    "<state file path and format>" \
  GATES    "<human gate list from Q7>"
```

Present the rendered box to the user. Do not write files until the user
approves. If anything is wrong, correct it in the elicit answers and re-render.

### Step 4b — Scaffold the building blocks

Split by durability:

**Durable (installed into the host's skill directory):**

These files do not change at runtime. Install them to
`<host-skills-dir>/<loop-name>/` using the templates in `templates/`:

1. `SKILL.md` — the loop's core skill (goal, action, discovery, call to
   verifier). Read-only each run. Generated from `templates/loop-SKILL.md.tmpl`.
2. `verifier.sh` — the tier-1 deterministic checker, adapted from
   `scripts/verifier_template.sh`. Binary exit code: 0 = condition holds; for
   the goal predicate that means "stop the loop"; for a per-iteration check it
   means "this attempt passed". 1 = condition does not hold (iterate / retry).
3. `HUMAN-GATES.md` — the gate list from Q7, plus the budget/stop rule.
   Generated from `templates/HUMAN-GATES.md.tmpl`.
4. `TRIGGER.md` — the trigger definition from Q2 (cron expression, event
   spec, or run-until-done config). Generated from `templates/TRIGGER.md.tmpl`.

**Two-tier only** — add these when the loop writes/modifies code and "done"
includes quality (see `pattern-two-tier-coding-review.md`):

- `review-rubric.md` — durable. The tier-2 axes, weights, threshold, and
  calibration examples. Generated from `templates/review-rubric.md.tmpl`.
- `review_gate.py` — durable. Copy `scripts/review_gate.py`; it turns the
  reviewer's JSON score into a binary exit code (senior bar: overall ≥ 0.85,
  every axis ≥ 0.70).

**Changing (written to the working tree, read+written each run):**

5. `loops/<loop-name>/STATE.md` (or the backend selected below) — the state
   file. Generated from `templates/STATE.md.tmpl`; initialize with the current
   timestamp and empty counters.
6. If durable knowledge was captured: a second installed skill at
   `<host-skills-dir>/<loop-name>-knowledge/SKILL.md` containing that
   read-only reference material.
7. `loops/<loop-name>/CONTRACT.md` — the checklist of testable assertions
   (what gets graded). Generated from `templates/CONTRACT.md.tmpl`; seeded from
   Q1 and awaiting G0 approval.
8. `loops/<loop-name>/log.md` — the append-only event log. Generated from
   `templates/log.md.tmpl`.

`CONTRACT.md`, `STATE.md`, and `log.md` are the **three files** the loop reads
to recover after a crash. If you cannot express the loop's whole state in these
three, the state is too complex — simplify before finishing (see rule below).

After scaffolding, print the file tree so the user can confirm nothing is
missing.

For a complete filled-in two-tier loop to model the output on — contract,
calibrated rubric, a passing and a failing iteration, state/log snapshots, and
the kickoff command — see `references/example-two-tier-coding-loop.md`.

### How the loop starts (tell the user this)

`loop-maker` writes the loop; it does not run it. After the user clears gate G0
(approves `CONTRACT.md`), the loop is launched with the prompt in `TRIGGER.md`.
On Claude Code that is typically `/loop` with the launch prompt — omit the
interval for run-until-done self-pacing, add one to poll on a cadence, or use
`/schedule` for an unattended routine. Always flag that `/loop` and `/schedule`
syntax is host-specific — verify against current docs; the paste-the-prompt
fallback works anywhere.

---

## State backend rule

Choose the state backend by isolation model, then record the choice in
`loops/<loop-name>/STATE.md` or document it in `TRIGGER.md`:

| Isolation model | State backend |
|---|---|
| Single worker (one run at a time) | `loops/<name>/STATE.md` — plain markdown, read+written each run |
| Parallel / worktree | GitHub Project or GitHub Issues — one issue per work item; resolved = done |
| Parallel but no GitHub | `loops/<name>/iterations.jsonl` — append-only; one JSON line per iteration |

The user may override this recommendation. Document the choice and the reason
for any override.

---

## Failure policy: restart within budget

A failed check — tier-1 red, tier-2 below the bar — is a **normal event, not an
emergency.** Within the budget in `HUMAN-GATES.md`, the loop retries or throws
the iteration away and restarts from a clean state, with no human involved.
Patching a broken attempt until the code becomes archaeology is worse than a
clean restart that ships two iterations later. Do not interrupt an ordinary
restart.

Pull in a human only when:

- the **contract itself** is wrong (the assertions describe the wrong thing), or
- the **budget** is exhausted (max iterations / cost / wall-clock), or
- an **irreversible action** is about to run (merge, publish, delete) — these
  gates are permanent.

Gate the *contract*, not the *build*. This replaces the old "halt on any
verifier exit 1" behavior; anomaly escalation now fires only after N
*consecutive* failures (set N in `HUMAN-GATES.md`), which is the signal that
restarting is not converging.

---

## Recover from three files

The loop must be able to crash, lose its session, and resume by reading exactly
three files: `CONTRACT.md` (what "done" means), `STATE.md` (where it left off),
and `log.md` (what happened). Context windows compact and rot; files on disk do
not. If you cannot describe the loop's entire state in these three files, the
state is too complicated — simplify the loop before declaring it scaffolded.

---

## Read the traces when a loop misbehaves

When a loop goes wrong, the fix comes from the transcript, not from another
guess. Pipe the run's output to `log.md`, find the entry where the model's
judgment first diverged from what you wanted, and fix the prompt (or the
contract) for that exact moment — then run again. This is reading a stack trace;
the difference is the trace is in English. Skipping this step means tuning by
vibe.

---

## Prune the harness (rule: don't let it grow monotonically)

The harness exists to compensate for the model. As models improve, part of what
this skill scaffolds becomes overhead the model now does for free. Whenever you
revisit a scaffolded loop — and before adding anything new to it — ask of each
file and each gate: *does the model still need this, or does it do this on its
own now?* Delete what has become dead weight. A harness that only ever grows is
a harness someone stopped reading. Prefer the smallest scaffold that still
recovers from three files and gates irreversible actions.

---

## Human gates + budget: non-negotiable

A loop without human gates can act in ways no one intended. A loop without a
budget can run forever or exhaust resources silently. Both are required.

- **Gates** must appear in `HUMAN-GATES.md` before the loop is considered
  scaffolded. At minimum: one gate before the first live run, one gate if the
  verifier signals an anomaly.
- **Budget** must appear in `HUMAN-GATES.md` as a hard stop: maximum
  iterations, maximum cost in dollars, maximum elapsed wall time, or all three.

Do not declare the loop done if either is missing. If the user skipped Q7 or
the budget capture, surface it now and collect the answers before writing files.

---

## Cross-harness note

This skill runs primarily on Claude Code, but the wizard describes actions in
host-neutral language: "dispatch a sub-agent", "read a file", "run a shell
command", "write a file". Before wiring a trigger, scheduler, or sub-agent
dispatch into a scaffolded loop, consult:

```
references/host-adapters.md
```

That file maps each abstract action to the current Claude Code mechanic
(`/loop`, `/schedule` cloud routines, ScheduleWakeup, Agent/Workflow tools,
WebSearch/WebFetch). For non-Claude hosts, verify scheduling/loop mechanics
against that host's current docs before scaffolding. Never hard-bind
scaffolded files to a single host's tool names — use the adapter layer so the
loop is portable.

---

## Output discipline checklist

Before handing off the scaffolded loop, verify all of the following. If any
item is missing, fix it before declaring done.

- [ ] All 7 questions answered (Goal · Trigger · Discovery · Action ·
      Verification · State · Human gates) and recorded in the blueprint
- [ ] Separate verifier file exists and has a binary exit code
- [ ] `CONTRACT.md` exists with testable assertions and is marked awaiting G0
      (human approval before first live run)
- [ ] **Two-tier only:** `review-rubric.md` and `review_gate.py` installed, and
      the reviewer is a separate agent/context from the generator
- [ ] The loop recovers from exactly three files: `CONTRACT.md`, `STATE.md`,
      `log.md` (state is not too complex to describe in three)
- [ ] `HUMAN-GATES.md` present with: G0 contract approval, one pre-run gate,
      one anomaly gate (N *consecutive* failures), and permanent gates for
      irreversible actions
- [ ] Budget / stop rule is written into `HUMAN-GATES.md` as a hard limit
      (restart-within-budget is the failure policy; budget is the brake)
- [ ] Harness pruned: nothing scaffolded that the model already does for free
- [ ] Trigger/scheduler syntax uses the current Claude Code mechanics —
      `/loop <prompt>` (self-paced) / `/loop <interval> <prompt>` /
      `/schedule` cloud routines — per `references/host-adapters.md`; for
      non-Claude hosts, flag "verify against that host's current docs"
