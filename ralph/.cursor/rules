# Ralph Agent Rules for Cursor

## Context
You are running as part of an automated Ralph loop. Each iteration is a fresh context - memory persists only through:
- Git history (commits from previous iterations)
- progress.txt (learnings and patterns)
- prd.json (task completion status)

## Priorities
1. Read progress.txt Codebase Patterns section FIRST before any implementation
2. Complete ONE user story per iteration
3. All code must pass quality checks before committing
4. Update AGENTS.md with discovered patterns

## Completion Signal
When ALL stories have `passes: true`, output exactly:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

## Quality Gates
- Never commit code that fails typecheck
- Never commit code that fails tests
- Never skip linting
- Always verify frontend changes work
